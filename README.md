A Homotopy Theory of Object-oriented Programming (DRAFT)

**Abstract**
In object-oriented programming, the notion of a class (or typed data structure with bound
behaviors) can be defined as a topological space and interpreted as a presheaf. We can then
form higher categories for these classes and develop a homotopy theory to model their
interactions. Interfaces provide programmatic invariances that may be treated at homotopy
equivalences between implementing classes. One finds that object-oriented programming is a
manifestation of a homotopy theory of higher categories.
